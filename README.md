# Food Delivery App

This project was actually made for a startup, which I was a partner in myself, but never could go on floors. Therefore, I am now releasing the code on Github.

## About the app
The app is a full-fledged solution for a food-delivery business. The app is actually focussed on home-kitchens and tiffin services. The app provides a complete solution for any food delivery business, and is integrated with mobile/email authorization, google map integration(currently, in the developer mode only, as API key is needed for unhindered use) and a robust UI that is designed keeping consideration of standards for a food business. The only part of the process not integrated is a payment handler.
